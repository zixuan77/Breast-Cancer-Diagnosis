## Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis

# Introduction
This project means to find the best-performance model which will accurately classify the tumor cells. The tumor is typically diagnosed as either malignant or benign. The response variable is recorded as 'diagnosis' in the data set with with categorical values "M"=Malignant and "B"=benign. Therefore, classification approach will be used in this project. Thirty features(predictors) will be implimented to fit the model, including the mean, standard error and worst value of various characteristics of tumor nuclei. These are features that directly computed from the tumor image that are most significant and explicit characteristics of tumor cells. Patterns of these measurements are likely to indicate the diagnosis results. 

This model is useful for the pathologist and other medical professionals. The machine learning model may help them determine the different patterns of malignant and benign tumors, which may not be easily noticed by eyes. Also, there are so many features that have to be considered at a time during diagnosis. A machine learning model provides a more efficient way for analysis. 

# What is FNA?
In an FNA, the doctor uses a very thin, hollow needle attached to a syringe to withdraw (aspirate) a small amount of breast tissue or fluid from a suspicious area. If an FNA is done to test a suspicious area in the breast, the sample is then checked for cancer cells.
